**The Mobile and Pervasive Computing Group** is located in the Engineering Education and Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. We focus on networking, design, and software engineering issues for emerging pervasive, ubiquitous, mobile, and opportunistic networked applications. We have a particular focus on context- and situation-awareness and how this information can be employed to make flexible adaptive applications that are responsive to their particular environments and their particular users' needs.
