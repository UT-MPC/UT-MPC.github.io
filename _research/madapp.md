title: MadApp
description:
    MadApp is an application-level development framework that provides tailored abstractions and support infrastructure for creating dynamic web pages that can incorporate received content from various opportunistic communication channels on-the-fly. Multiple application scenarios exist in which these constructs can seamlessly apply. By constructing expressive exemplars from these domains, we have shown that MadApp can enable opportunistic mobile computing applications to begin to leverage the significant advances in delay-tolerant communication research, opening doors for even more dynamic and adaptive applications.
