title: Pharos
description:
    Pharos is a testbed that supports the validation of perception, control, and coordination in pervasive and mobile computing environments. The testbed's physical space, hardware, software, and rich application scenarios support research and discovery at a variety of levels. We support research in sensor management, network coding, wireless protocols, localization, multi-agent coordination, fault-tolerant systems, and software simulation validation.
