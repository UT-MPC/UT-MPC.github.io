title: Grapevine
description:
    Grapevine is a framework that enables applications to share context information in a localized region of a pervasive computing network, use that information to dynamically form groups defined by their shared situations, and assess the aggregate context of that group.
    <br>
    <br>
    Moving beyond more typical egocentric world views, Grapevine allows an application to distribute its own context information while simultaneously leveraging the context information it receives to modify its behavior and aggregate task-relevant group context information that can also distributed within the network. We use novel data structures such as probabilistic Bloomier filters to represent context information efficiently and minimize the network resources required to support Grapevine's use.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our long term vision is a framework that allows a pervasive computing application developer to delegate all context related functionality to Grapevine and focus solely on the task at hand. Instead of spending time determining what context information is needed, who it should be sent to, and managing the lifecycle of the information it has received, a Grapevine-enabled application can merely indicate the context information it has to offer and the context information it is interested in receiving. Achieving this vision leaves many interesting research challenges such as communicating and responding to interest gradients within the network, determining the frequency with which information should be sent, assessing a quality metric for the context information on hand, and finding ways to provide all this functionality without placing undue burden on the limited resources available to pervasive computing platforms.
