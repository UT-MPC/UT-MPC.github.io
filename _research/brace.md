title: Brace
description:
    Brace is a framework that allows developers to explicitly specify both physical and logical assumptions and expected behaviors. Brace then enables run-time checking of these combined physical and logical specifications, provided in the form of assertions, using the physical environment in which a CPS application is running. Brace uses physics models and temporal semantics to guide CPS developers in creating appropriate assertions and to check specified assertions for inconsistencies with the physical world.
