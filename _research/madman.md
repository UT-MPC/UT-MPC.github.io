description:
    Our group does a variety of research related to middleware architectures for delay-tolerant networks. In general, our approaches focus on using adaptation to ensure that nodes in DTNs opportunistically and automatically make use of the available connection opportunities in these highly unpredictable environments. We have performed these adaptations at the "macro" level, adapting the entire network stack from a "traditional" mobile ad hoc network stack to a "delay-tolerant" network stack when conditions dictate such a change. We also explore this a the "micro" level, developing adaptations within the DTN stack that, for example, change the nature and behavior of network coding in response to contextual information.
