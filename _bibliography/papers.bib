abstract = {In this paper, we define a learning activity for an elementary physical education classroom that simultaneously engages students in physical activity while introducing students to basic principles of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a sub-domain of machine learning in which an independent agent (in our activity, a student) takes some action or series of actions and receives a reward for the chosen action(s). While reinforcement learning intuitively maps to many activities in our daily lives, our learning activity involves a spy game. Students create sequences of spy moves that generate rewards based on their component moves and the orders in which they are performed. Students then iteratively expand their spy moves in an attempt to receive the maximum reward. The construction of the game will demonstrate that the rewards, while deterministic, do not always follow a greedy pattern, introducing students to basic algorithmic principles. Such an approach that combines physical activity with reinforcement learning connects artificial intelligence education within the broader scope of computing and students' everyday lives.},

Based on the idea of transmitting data by modulating light, we are able to (1) share a secret key within a constrained physical space and (2) communicate encrypted information among co-located mobile devices using the shared key. We present the demonstration Jive (<u>J</u>oint <u>I</u>ntegration of <u>V</u>LC and <u>E</u>ncryption), a framework to support secret key sharing over Visible Light Communication. In defining Jive, we tackle challenges related to data encoding, message synchronization, and environmental noise to build a reliable, low complexity system using off-the shelf hardware. Our system is capable of sending encryption keys at speeds of more than 750bps using ultra short, high speed light pulses imperceptible to the human eye. Additionally, we have developed an application for Android that interfaces with the VLC device through serial communication so that applications running on mobile devices can subsequently use the keys to encrypt application data. Experimental results illustrate the high accuracy of our system across a variety of different variables. Finally, we position our system for use by a variety of applications that require a high-level of data security among physically co-located devices.},

In this demonstration, we showcase our complete implementation of Jive: a VLC transmitter and a VLC receiver. Both endpoints are built using off-the-shelf components. The VLC link is used to distribute a randomly generated secret key that can only be "observed" by VLC receivers that are physically in the same space as the transmitter. Each receiver is connected over a serial connection to an Android device; we developed applications for Android that take the key from the VLC receiver and subsequently use the key to encrypt or decrypt application data. Our demo invites participants to create their own encrypted messages in the Android application and interact with the VLC prototype as it transmits encryption keys, thus illustrating our system's ability to bootstrap security among physically co-located devices.},

However, considering the heterogeneity of Internet of Things devices, connecting devices with differences in capabilities–processing, storage, energy, and communication bandwidth–and programming methods–language, compiler, and tools–can burden developers with the complexities caused by interoperability. This paper proposes a solution to address this interoperability issue when sharing information among IoT devices. We model information sharing as the communication between a sender and a receiver with constraints from application requirements. We explore tradeoffs from constraints to propose three strategies to hide technical details of various data representations to meet their application needs. We propose the CHITCHAT Information Sharing Language (CISL) for developing IoT applications so that IoT developers can focus solely on their applications by delegating the control of information sharing details to the features that the CISL language provides.},

  abstractnote = {Securing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) against cyber-attacks is challenging due to the wide range of possible attacks – from stealthy ones that seek to manipulate/drop/delay control and measurement signals to malware that infects host machines that control the physical process. This has prompted the research community to address this problem through developing targeted methods that protect and check the run-time operation of the CPS. Since protecting signals and checking for errors result in performance penalties, they must be performed within the delay bounds dictated by the control loop. Due to the large number of potential checks that can be performed, coupled with various degrees of their effectiveness to detect a wide range of attacks, strategic assignment of these checks in the control loop is a critical endeavor. To that end, this paper presents a coherent runtime framework – which we coin BLOC – for orchestrating the CPS with check blocks to secure them against cyber attacks. BLOC capitalizes on game theoretical techniques to enable the defender to ﬁnd an optimal randomized use of check blocks to secure the CPS while respecting the control-loop constraints. We develop a Stackelberg game model for stateless blocks and a Markov game model for stateful ones and derive optimal policies that minimize the worst-case damage from rational adversaries. We validate our models through extensive simulations as well as a real implementation for a HVAC system.},

  title        = {Using the Internet of Things to Teach Good Software Engineering Practice to High School Students},
  abstractnote = {This paper describes a course to introduce high school students to software engineering in practice using the Internet Of Things (IoT). IoT devices allow students to get quick, visible results without watering down technical aspects of programming and networking. The course has three broad goals: (1) to make software engineering fun and applicable, with the aim of recruiting traditionally underrepresented groups into computing; (2) to make young students begin to approach problems with a design mindset; and (3) to show students that computer science, generally, and software engineering, specifically, is about much more than programming. The course unfolds in three segments. The first is a whirlwind introduction to a subset of IoT technologies. Students complete a specific task (or set of tasks) using each technology. This segment culminates in a “do-it-yourself” project, in which the students implement a simple IoT application using their basic knowledge of the technologies. The course's second segment introduces software engineering practices, again primarily via hands-on practical tutorials. In the third segment of the course, the students conceive of, design, and implement a project that uses the technologies introduced in the first segment, all while being attentive to the good software engineering practices acquired in the second segment. In addition to presenting the course curriculum, the paper also discusses a first offering of the course in a threeweek summer intensive program in 2017, including assessments done to evaluate the curriculum.},

Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous devices, often employing diverse communication technologies with varying energy consumption, discovery ranges, and transmission rates. These complexities pose a daunting setting for the development of IoT applications that could leverage direct communication with proximal mobile and embedded devices. While current approaches focus either on device discovery in the IoT setting or content transfer assuming established communication channels, none facilitate the intelligent discovery of useful devices and the seamless formation of temporary D2D connections to transfer content directly between devices. Our Omni middleware provides both of these features critical in the development of applications that leverage proximal devices in IoT settings. Using Omni, we demonstrate the feasibility of building applications that use heterogeneous D2D communication channels in an efficient and realistic (in terms of energy and time) manner.},

  abstractnote = {Today's “smart” domains are driven by lightweight battery operated devices carried by people and embedded in environments. Many applications rely on continuous neighbor discovery, i.e., the ability to detect other nearby devices. Application uses for neighbor discovery are widely varying, but they all rely on a protocol in which devices exchange periodic beacons containing device identiﬁers. Many applications also ultimately involve assessing and adapting to context information sensed about the physical world and the device's situation in that world (e.g., its location or speed, the ambient temperature or sound, etc.). In this paper, we deﬁne Proactive Implicit Neighborhood Context Heuristics (PINCH), which leverages unused payload in periodic neighbor discovery beacons to opportunistically distribute context information in a local area. PINCH's selforganizing algorithms use limited local views of the state of a one-hop network neighborhood to determine the most useful type of context information for a device to sense and share. In this paper, we develop the algorithms, integrate an implementation of PINCH with a smart city simulator, and benchmark the tradeoffs of self-organized local context sharing with 2.4GHz neighbor discovery beacons.},

  abstractnote = {Our reliance on cyber–physical systems (CPSs) is increasingly widespread, but scalable methods for the analysis of such systems remain a signiﬁcant challenge. Runtime veriﬁcation of CPSs provides a reasonable middle ground between formal veriﬁcation and simulation approaches, but it comes with its own challenges. A runtime veriﬁcation system must run directly on the deployed application. In the CPS domain, it is therefore critical that a runtime veriﬁcation system exhibits low overhead and good scalability so that the veriﬁcation does not interfere with the analyzed CPS application. In this paper, we introduce Brace, a runtime veriﬁcation system whose focus is on ensuring these performance qualities for applications in the CPS domain. Brace strives to bound the computation overhead for CPS runtime veriﬁcation while preserving a high level of monitoring accuracy in terms of the number of false positive and false negative reports. Brace is particularly suitable to systems in which scheduling is distributed across networked CPS components. We evaluate Brace to determine how effectively and efﬁciently it can detect injected errors in two existing real-life CPS applications with distributed scheduling. Our results demonstrate that Brace efﬁciently detects those errors and a few true bugs and is able to bound both the memory and computation overhead even in systems with large numbers of observed events.},

While many solutions exist, they o en take a theoretical approach, reasoning about protocol behavior with an abstract model that makes simplifying assumptions about the environment. is approach creates a gap between protocol implementations and the models used during design and analysis. In this paper, we take a system approach to continuous neighbor discovery: starting with the concrete technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) we build a protocol, called BLEnd, tailored to its constraints. Moreover, we also consider the very real e ects of packet collisions, to our knowledge a rst in this domain. Our ultimate goal is to directly empower developers with the ability to determine the optimal protocol con guration for their applications; in this respect, the slotless operation of BLEnd o ers richer alternatives than state-of-the-art protocols. Developers specify the minimum discovery probability, the target discovery latency, and the maximum expected node density; these are used by an optimizer tool to parameterize the BLEnd implementation towards maximum lifetime. is paper shows that BLEnd not only achieves the user-speci ed goals, but does so more e ciently than analogous con gurations of competing protocols.},

For instance, dissenting opinions exist as to whether formal methods (including static analysis, theorem proving, and model checking) are appropriate in CPS veriﬁcation and validation. Simulation tools and simulation-based testing are also often considered insufﬁcient for cyber-physical systems. Many “experts” posit that high-level programming languages (e.g., Java or C#) are not applicable to CPS due to their inability to address (signiﬁcant) resource constraints at a high level of abstraction. To date, empirical studies investigating these questions have not been done. In this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze why debugging cyber-physical systems remains challenging and either dispel or conﬁrm these strongly held beliefs along the way.

The devices belonging to a group of co-located people may need to detect a shared activity (e.g., a meeting) to adapt their devices to support the activity. Today's devices are almost universally equipped with device-to-device communication that easily enables direct context sharing. While existing context sharing models tend not to consider devices' resource limitations or users' constraints, enabling devices to directly share context has signiﬁcant beneﬁts for efﬁciency, cost, and privacy. However, as we demonstrate quantitatively, when devices share context via device-to-device communication, it needs to be represented in a size-efﬁcient way that does not sacriﬁce its expressiveness or accuracy. We present CHITCHAT, a suite of context representations that allows application developers to tune tradeoffs between the size of the representation, the ﬂexibility of the application to update context information, the energy required to create and share context, and the quality of the information shared. We can substantially reduce the size of context representation (thereby reducing applications' overheads when they share their contexts with one another) with only a minimal reduction in the quality of shared contexts.},

Device-to-device communications (without the support of an infrastructure) will play a critical role in facilitating transparent access to proximate digital resources. A variety of approaches exist to support device-todevice dissemination, yet very few capitalize on the contextual history of disseminated data itself to distribute additional data. We introduce a fully decentralized model that captures the causal history of shared information across a lifetime of device-to-device propagation. Our approach enhances each transmitted message with a spatiotemporal trajectory, a portion of the message's contextual history, which provides a window into the time-varying state of the network and the overall spreading behavior of the message. We benchmark the performance of spatiotemporal trajectories at a global level and demonstrate the practical utility of our constructs for making intelligent distributed routing decisions through two use cases. The ﬁrst illustrates how locallyavailable contextual history may be used to make inferences about remote nodes' knowledge and thus direct routing of future messages. The second example uses trajectories from different types of data to identify commonly co-located data and devices, which can then be used as substitutable routing targets.},

  abstractnote = {In pervasive computing environments, understanding the context of an entity is essential for adapting the application behavior to changing situations. In our view, context is a high-level representation of a user or entity's state and can capture location, activities, social relationships, capabilities, etc. Inherently, however, these high-level context metrics are difﬁcult to capture using uni-modal sensors only and must therefore be inferred using multi-modal sensors. A key challenge in supporting context-aware pervasive computing is how to determine multiple high-level context metrics simultaneously and energy-efﬁciently using low-level sensor data streams collected from the environment and the entities present therein. A key challenge is addressing the fact that the algorithms that determine different high-level context metrics may compete for access to low-level sensors. In this paper, we ﬁrst highlight the complexities of determining multiple context metrics as compared to a single context and then develop a novel framework and practical implementation for this problem. The proposed framework captures the tradeoff between the accuracy of estimating multiple context metrics and the overhead incurred in acquiring the necessary sensor data streams. In particular, we develop two variants of a heuristic algorithm for multi-context search that compute the optimal set of sensors contributing to the multi-context determination as well as the associated parameters of the sensing tasks (e.g., the frequency of data acquisition). Our goal is to satisfy the application requirements for a speciﬁed accuracy at a minimum cost. We compare the performance of our heuristics with a brute-force based approach for multi-context determination. Experimental results with SunSPOT, Shimmer and Smartphone sensors in smart home environments demonstrate the potential impact of the proposed framework.},

  abstractnote = {Mobile devices continue to push the limits of contextually aware application intelligence. However, due to the complexity of contextual processing and programming, a centralized system that handles all mobile context processing is diﬃcult to realize. The problem of deﬁning such a contextual reasoning unit that uses an all-encompassing contextual ontology for all possible uses of context is not feasible nor useful. Furthermore, implementing custom contextual logic ad hoc per application is diﬃcult due to the complexity of sensor monitoring and contextual reasoning and may be redundant across applications. In this work we propose an openly developed dynamic ontology formation that allows developers to contribute logical pieces to a greater network of contextual reasoning for use by application developers. Speciﬁcally, we introduce Mason, a framework for supporting modular contextual reasoning development by handling low-level sensor routing and abstracting data sources as composable and functionally reactive data streams. This provisions for high levels of abstraction for contextual logic developers that contribute to the framework as well as application developers that use it. We demonstrate the simplicity of developing with Mason and show, through an audit of open source applications, the increased contextual functionality oﬀered, better enabling the next generation of contextually reactive applications.},

However, when applications need access to highly transient and hyper-localized information, web access is not as efﬁcient as sharing directly with colocated devices. This context information can be easily collected by commodity mobile devices and shared via device-to-device interactions. Open challenges remain in making this exchange as efﬁcient and effective as possible. In this paper, we propose the Grapevine Context Processor (GCP), which provides a framework and a set of APIs for representing and sharing context information. GCP is built on the Grapevine context sharing framework, which is underpinned by a suite of novel spaceefﬁcient context representing data structures. GCP, as a context processing framework, enables application developers to easily specify context types of interest and provide relevant semantic ﬁlters for those types; we design a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow easy access to and control over the data structures.},

Grapevine provides a very lightweight but potentially lossy way to efﬁciently share context information among a group of co-located pervasive computing devices using just device-to-device connections to exchange small bits of context information. Further, Grapevine embodies abstractions that allow ﬂexible deﬁnition of contextdeﬁned groups, i.e., clusters of co-located users that are similar in some way based on their context values. MoodChat uses Grapevine to share context about device users' personal states (i.e., mood), including an individual's own assessment of his mood but also values sensed about the device or environment that might also be indicative of the user's mood (e.g., the level of ambient sound, the number and length of sent or received text messages, etc.). Co-located users with the same assessed level of mood are connected into groups, and users within the same group can chat with one another. The demonstration will allow the visitors to interact in MoodChat as one of the users, showing how contextdeﬁned groups can enable a wide range of ﬂexible pervasive computing applications.},

  abstractnote = {Today's mobile and pervasive computing devices are embedded with increasingly powerful sensing capabilities that enable them to provide exceptional spatio-temporal context acquisition that is not possible with traditional static sensor networks alone. As a result, enabling these devices to share context information with one another has a great potential for enabling mobile users to exploit the nearby cyber and physical environments in participatory or human-centric computing. However, because these mobile devices are owned by and sense information about individuals, sharing the acquired context raises signiﬁcant privacy concerns. In this paper, we deﬁne Magpie, which implements an alternative to existing all-or-nothing sharing solutions. Magpie integrates a decentralized context-dependent and adaptive trust scheme with a privacy preserving sharing mechanism to evaluate the risk of disclosing potentially private data. The proposed method uses this assessment to dynamically determine the sharing strategy and the quality of the context shared. Conceptually, Magpie allows devices to actively obfuscate context information so that sharing is still useful but does not breach user privacy. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst work to take both trust relationships and users' individual privacy sensitivities into account to balance sharing and privacy preservation. We describe Magpie and then evaluate it in a series of application-oriented experiments running on the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator.},

Building shared views of context requires exchanging sensed information, often via peerto-peer links. In-network aggregation enables efﬁcient distributed data collection, but the goal has been almost exclusively collect a single aggregate value at a single sink node. In contrast, we design and implement a simple protocol for exchanging context information in aggregate in a peer-to-peer fashion, where every node needs to acquire a shared view of the aggregate context. In our protocol, when a node receives new context information from a neighboring node, it aggregates the new information into its local view of the shared state of the world which it then subsequently shares with its neighbors. We demonstrate (both theoretically and empirically) the situations in which participants' raw context information is fully or partially recoverable by other participants from an aggregate and quantify the tradeoff in communication overhead for the quality of shared context knowledge. Compared with non-aggregation communication for sharing context values among 100 nodes in a simulated network, we show an overhead savings of at least 78.0%, and an overhead savings of 66.0% with 99.8% average accuracy in a 54 node emulated network driven by real world data.},

Along with the widespread emergence of ubiquitous computing and the availability of context information comes threats to personal privacy that result from sharing information about ourselves with others in the vicinity. We deﬁne an individual's context to be a potentially private piece of information. Given the individual context of multiple participants, one can compute an aggregate context that represents a shared state while at the same time preserves individual participants' privacy. In this paper, we describe three approaches to computing an aggregate measure of a group's context while maintaining a balance between the desire to share information and the desire to retain control over private information. Our approaches allow dynamic tuning of information release according to trust levels of the participants within communication range. By evaluating our approaches through simulation, we show that sharing aggregate context can signiﬁcantly increase the rate at which a group of co-located users learns an aggregate measure of their shared context. Further, our approaches can accomplish high quality context sharing even in situations with low levels of trust, assuming the availability of a small number of highly trustworthy partners.},

  abstractnote = {Even as the use of sensor networks to support mobile applications grows, our ability to seamlessly and eﬃciently incorporate sensor network capabilities into our mobile applications remains astoundingly diﬃcult. Today, accessing remote sensing data and integrating this data into the adaptive behavior of a dynamic user-facing mobile application requires interacting with multiple platforms, languages, data formats, and communication paradigms. We present BraceForce, an open and extensible middleware that allows developers to access the myriad remote sensing capabilities inherent to today's mobile computing spaces (where mobile devices and sensors are closely integrated) using very minimal code. Further, BraceForce incorporates event- and model-driven data acquisition as ﬁrst-class concepts to provide eﬃcient access to sensing while retaining expressiveness and ﬂexibility for applications. We present the BraceForce architecture and key abstractions, describe their implementations, and provide an empirical study using BraceForce to support mobile applications integrating sensing.},

As context information and the applications that consume it become increasingly diverse, they will need an eﬃcient means to indicate tailored interest in this context information. This paper proposes a new probabilistic data structure, spatiotemporal Bloom ﬁlters (SpTBF) or “spitty bifs,” which allow nodes to eﬃciently store and share their context interests. SpTBF provide both spatiotemporal locality and a ﬁne-grained ability to control how context interests are disseminated.

  abstractnote = {Multi-robot patrol is a fundamental application of multi-robot systems. While much theoretical work exists providing an understanding of the optimal patrol strategy for teams of coordinated homogeneous robots, little work exists on building and evaluating the performance of such systems for real. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of multirobot patrol in a practical outdoor distributed robotic system, and evaluate the effect of different coordination schemes on the performance of the robotic team. The multi-robot patrol algorithms evaluated vary in the level of robot coordination: no coordination, loose coordination, and tight coordination. In addition, we evaluate versions of these algorithms that distribute state information—either individual state, or entire team state (global-view state). Our experiments show that while tight coordination is theoretically optimal, it is not practical in practice. Instead, uncoordinated patrol performs best in terms of average waypoint visitation frequency, though loosely coordinated patrol that shares only individual state performed best in terms of worst-case frequency. Both are signiﬁcantly better than a loosely coordinated algorithm based on sharing global-view state. We respond to this discrepancy between theory and practice, caused primarily by robot heterogeneity, by extending the theory to account for such heterogeneity, and ﬁnd that the new theory accounts for the empirical results.},

  abstractnote = {Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is a new intersection control protocol that exploits the capabilities of autonomous vehicles to control trafﬁc at intersections in a way better than trafﬁc signals and stop signs. A key assumption of this protocol is that vehicles can always follow their trajectories. But mechanical failures can occur in real life, causing vehicles to deviate from their trajectories. A previous approach for handling mechanical failure was to prevent vehicles from entering the intersection after the failure. However, this approach cannot prevent collisions among vehicles already in the intersection or too close to stop because (1) the lack of coordination among vehicles can cause collisions during the execution of evasive actions; and (2) the intersection may not have enough room for evasive actions. In this paper, we propose a preemptive approach that pre-computes evasion plans for several common types of mechanical failures before vehicles enter an intersection. This preemptive approach is necessary because there are situations in which vehicles cannot evade without pre-allocation of space for evasion. We present a modiﬁed AIM protocol and demonstrate the effectiveness of evasion plan execution on a miniature autonomous intersection testbed.},

To address this, we propose BRACE, a framework that simpliﬁes the process by enabling developers to correlate cyber (i.e., logical) and physical properties of the system via assertions. This paper presents our initial investigation into the requirements and semantics of such assertions, which we call CPS assertions.

To enable this autonomy, it is imperative that cyber-physical infrastructure be deployed to enable efﬁcient control and communication. An essential component of such road instrumentation is intersection management. This paper develops an intersection management platform that provides the sensing and communication infrastructure needed to enable efﬁcient intersection management policies. The testbed, located in a indoor laboratory, consists of an intersection and multiple robotic vehicles that can sense and communicate. Whereas traditional approaches to intersection management rely on simulations, this testbed enables the ﬁrst realistic evaluation of several intersection management policies. Six simple but practical centralized and distributed policies are evaluated and compared against the current state of the art, i.e., trafﬁc signals and stop signs. Through extensive experimentation, this paper concludes that, in the scenario tested, even a simple coordinated management policy can halve vehicular delay, while improving the aggregate traversal time of the intersection by 169%.},

Much work over the past decade focused on how to acquire and represent context information. However, this work is largely egocentric, focusing on individual entities in the pervasive computing environment sensing their own context. Distributed acquisition of surrounding context information is much more challenging, largely because of the expense of communication among these resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Grapevine, a framework for efﬁciently sharing context information in a localized region of a pervasive computing network, using that information to dynamically form groups deﬁned by their shared situations, and assessing the aggregate context of that group. We provide an implementation of Grapevine and benchmark its performance in a live pervasive computing network deployment.},

The requisite support for general-purpose expressive search of the “here” and “now” has eluded realization due to the complexities of indexing, storing, and retrieving relevant information within a vast collection of highly ephemeral data. We aim to address this gap in the research (i) through search mechanisms that are sensitive to the bearings of space and time on the relevance of search results and (ii) more fundamentally, through the design of a general-purpose data model that facilitates information availability in pervasive computing environments and exposes spatial and temporal relationships between digital data and physical phenomena.

Delay-tolerant networking technology oﬀers the means to do just this. We introduce MADServer, a novel DTN-based architecture for mobile data oﬄoading that splits web content among multiple independent delivery vectors based on user and data context. It enables intelligent data oﬄoading, caching, and querying solutions which can be incorporated in a manner that still satisﬁes user expectations for timely delivery. At the same time, it allows for users who have poor or expensive connections to the cellular network to leverage multi-hop opportunistic routing to send and receive data. We also present a preliminary implementation of MADServer and provide real-world performance evaluations.},

  abstractnote = {Pervasive computing applications often involve sensor-rich networking environments that capture various types of user contexts such as locations, activities, vital signs, and so on. Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example monitoring health information to promote independent living in “aging-in-place” scenarios, or providing safety and security of people and infrastructures. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, thus leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Therefore, a signiﬁcant challenge in the design and development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications lies in the ability to deal with ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource-optimized, quality-assured context mediation framework for sensor networks. The underlying approach is based on efﬁcient context-aware data fusion, information-theoretic reasoning, and selection of sensor parameters, leading to an optimal state estimation. In particular, we apply dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.},

Entities in these environments are not in isolation, and oftentimes the manner in which entities coordinate depends on some (implicit) notion of their shared context. In this paper, we are motivated by the need to explicitly construct notions of the context of a group that can support better coordination within the group. First we identify an eﬃcient representation of context (both of an individual and of a group) that can be shared across wireless connections without incurring a signiﬁcant communication overhead. Second we provide precise semantics for diﬀerent types of groups, each with compelling use cases in these dynamic computing environments. Finally, we deﬁne and demonstrate protocols for eﬃciently computing groups and their context in a distributed manner.},

Queries in these dynamic networks come in two forms: snapshot queries and continuous queries. The former executes through the network and returns values that satisfy the query criteria at a particular instant in time. The latter expects a result that is updated over time to reﬂect changes in the system. The ﬁdelity, or quality, of the results of these queries can be signiﬁcantly impacted by the unpredictability of the dynamic network; as the query is distributed and executed, changes that occur due to network and environmental dynamics can cause the query to miss potential results or to report inconsistent information. Our previous work has shown how we can provide semantically meaningful statements about the ﬁdelity, or quality, of the result of a snapshot query in a dynamic networked environment. In this paper, we demonstrate how this ﬁdelity can also be used to adapt a continuous query's processing to make its execution best match the conditions in the underlying dynamic environment.},

The results indicate that the tested localization algorithms performed less well on the construction jobsite than they did in the operating building. The simple MinMax algorithm has better performance than other algorithms, with average errors as low as 1.2 m with a beacon density of 0.186/m2. The Ring Overlapping Circle RSSI algorithm was also shown to have good results and avoids implementation difﬁculties of other algorithms. k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, previously explored by other construction researchers, have good accuracy in some test cases but may be particularly sensitive to beacon positioning.},

To deploy applications successfully in MANETs, application developers need to comprehend the potential behavior of any underlying protocol used. In mobile networks, a major component of many of these routing protocols is some form of ﬂooding, which facilitates message delivery over an entire network in a relatively reliable way. Several MANET protocols use ﬂooding to support the distribution of route request messages as well as delivering broadcast packets. Therefore, to developers of applications for MANETs, a major task in understanding MANET protocols is estimating the performance of ﬂooding in a given operating environment. In this work, we develop an analytical model for the delay experienced in ﬂooding a message. We model the one hop delay of a ﬂooding message in MANETs in terms of parameters that can be acquired either from a system conﬁguration or from application designers.},

In distributed settings, query semantics are well-defined, for example, queries are often designed to satisfy ACID transactional properties. When query processing is introduced in a dynamic network setting, achieving transactional semantics becomes complex due to the open and unpredictable environment. In this article, we propose a query processing model for mobile ad hoc and sensor networks that is suitable for expressing a wide range of query semantics; the semantics differ in the degree of consistency with which query results reflect the state of the environment during query execution. We introduce several distinct notions of consistency and formally express them in our model. A practical and significant contribution of this article is a protocol for query processing that automatically assesses and adaptively provides an achievable degree of consistency given the operational environment throughout its execution. The protocol attaches an assessment of the achieved guarantee to returned query results, allowing precise reasoning about a query with a range of possible semantics. We evaluate the performance of this protocol and demonstrate the benefits accrued to applications through examples drawn from an industrial application.},

However, it is extremely difﬁcult and expensive to obtain a continuous, complete, and consistent picture of a continuously evolving operating environment. One standard technique to mitigate this problem is to employ mathematical models that compute missing data from sampled observations thereby approximating a continuous and complete stream of information. However, existing models have traditionally not incorporated a notion of temporal validity, or the quantiﬁcation of imprecision associated with inferring data values from past or future observations. In this paper, we support continuous monitoring of dynamic pervasive computing phenomena through the use of a series of snapshot queries. We deﬁne a decay function and a set of inference approaches to ﬁlling in missing and uncertain data in this continuous query. We evaluate the usefulness of this abstraction in its application to complex spatiotemporal pattern queries in pervasive computing networks.},

Concurrently executing applications requires the network's resources to be shared across applications so as to make the best long-term utilization of the constrained devices and communications network. This resource sharing entails tradeoffs in the ﬁdelity offered to individual applications. Fidelity is an application-dependent concept that can denote a variety of operational measures including communication latency, data quality, and redundancy. In this paper, we present a principled way to deﬁne the ﬁdelity associated with an application given a particular allocation of the available resources. Given a desired set of applications to deploy, we also explore the impact of sharing resources among the applications in terms of ﬁdelity degradation to individual applications. To this end, we provide an algorithm that determines the optimal subset of applications to deploy given the available resources and the potential impact on ﬁdelity and evaluate it.},

A large body of research has addressed many issues in hardware and software for the future, but few have focused on the users.

To bridge this gap between what technology can provide and what users need and want from ubiquitous computing, we motivate the need for end-user programming in ubiquitous computing environments and provide a vision for enabling end-user programming. We believe that the software engineering community must provide end-user programming capabilities in ubiquitous computing environments if this domain is to reach its full potential.},

  abstractnote = {Wireless sensor networks are emerging as a convenient mechanism to constantly monitor the physical world. The volume of information in such networks can be extremely large and, to be meaningful to applications, this information must be processed at the right level of accuracy. However, there is an inherent trade-off between achieving a high degree of data accuracy and the communication overhead associated with achieving it. We present a simple mechanism for spatially approximate query processing. We present a protocol that leverages gossip based routing to collect network data from a randomly selected set of nodes at a user-deﬁned level of accuracy. We extend this protocol to address persistent queries, long running queries where network data is collected periodically, by treating a persistent query as a temporal aggregate of individual queries. Finally, we provide a novel protocol that dynamically adapts its accuracy based on the quality of the responses to individual requests in the persistent query. We describe this protocol in detail and evaluate its performance through simulation.},

  abstractnote = {Pervasive computing applications often entail continuous monitoring tasks, issuing persistent queries that return continuously updated views of the operational environment. We present PAQ, a middleware that supports applications' needs by approximating a persistent query as a sequence of one-time queries. PAQ introduces an integration strategy abstraction that allows composition of one-time query responses into streams representing sophisticated spatio-temporal phenomena of interest. A distinguishing feature of our middleware is the realization that the suitability of a persistent query's result is a function of the application's tolerance for accuracy weighed against the associated overhead costs. In PAQ, programmers can specify an inquiry strategy that dictates how information is gathered. Since network dynamics impact the suitability of a particular inquiry strategy, PAQ associates an introspection strategy with a persistent query, that evaluates the quality of the query's results. The result of introspection can trigger application-deﬁned adaptation strategies that alter the nature of the query. PAQ's simple API makes developing adaptive querying systems easily realizable. We present the key abstractions, describe their implementations, and demonstrate the middleware's usefulness through application examples and evaluation.},

While queries are a convenient way to obtain information, the highly dynamic nature of such networks makes it diﬃcult to ensure a precise match between the results returned by a query and the actual state of the enterprise. However, decisions can be made based on the perceived quality of the information retrieved; specialized query support is needed to control and assess the accuracy of the query results. In this paper, we introduce the notion of inquiry mode to allow the user to exercise control over the query processing policy so as to match the level of accuracy to the requirements of the task. In addition, we describe the use of query introspection, a process for assessing the ﬁtness of a particular inquiry mode. Both concepts are formalized, illustrated, and evaluated.},

  abstractnote = {Ubiquitous (or smart) healthcare applications envision sensor rich computing and networking environments that can capture various types of contexts of patients (or inhabitants of the environment), such as their location, activities and vital signs. Such context information is useful in providing health related and wellness management services in an intelligent way so as to promote independent living. However, in reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts may often be ambiguous, leading to fatal decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a signiﬁcant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for healthcare applications is the ability to deal with ambiguous contexts to prevent hazardous situations. In this work, we propose a quality assured context mediation framework, based on efﬁcient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic system parameter selection for optimal state estimation in resource constrained sensor network. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian network to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. It has the ability to incorporate context representation according to the applications' quality requirement. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.},

Such applications are characterized by the fact that information needs to be distributed among all members of a group. Supporting such coordination currently requires using lowlevel multicast protocols that are complex and resource intensive to initialize and maintain without the support of an infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce the ring overlay for collaborative coordination (ROCC), which offers a fair, reliable coordination service for wireless environments. ROCC speciﬁcally addresses wireless application situations requiring group coordination. ROCC is inﬂuenced by traditional token ring and overlay communication protocols but leverages unique properties of the broadcast nature of the wireless environment to improve performance. The result is a minimal, fair, dynamic group coordination service. This paper introduces the ROCC abstraction and demonstrates its potential through analysis.},

This creates an opportunity for workers to access sensors in an ad hoc manner as they move through a job site. However, re-tasking and re-use of sensor data in a dynamic setting presents significant challenges including ad hoc identification of sensors in a local environment, the generalization of sensor information, and the use of such dynamic info for decision support applications. All these tasks require coordinated advancement of a variety of information and communication technologies. To achieve a generalized approach to make use of local sensor data, this paper describes a three-layer architecture which abstracts functionality into three corresponding tiers: a layer for sensor communication that handles physical communication between devices; a middle-layer for data processing and abstraction of sensor data from specific devices; and a top layer for decision support applications. At each of the three tiers in the architecture the level of abstraction increases, allowing for development of decision support applications at the top level that are not directly tied to specific sensors or computing devices. This paper demonstrates the usefulness and versatility of the proposed three-tier architecture by describing two safety applications envisaged for the Intelligent Job Site.},

  abstractnote = {Queries are convenient abstractions for the discovery of information and services, as they oﬀer content-based information access. In distributed settings, query semantics are well-deﬁned, e.g., queries are often designed to satisfy the ACID transactional properties. When query processing is introduced in a dynamic network setting, achieving transactional semantics becomes complex due to the open and unpredictable environment. In this paper, we propose a query processing model for mobile ad hoc and sensor networks that is suitable for expressing a wide range of query semantics; the semantics diﬀer in the degree of consistency with which query results reﬂect the state of the environment during query execution. We introduce several distinct notions of consistency and formally express them in our model. A practical and signiﬁcant contribution of this paper is a protocol for query processing that automatically assesses and adaptively provides an achievable degree of consistency given the state of the operational environment throughout its execution. The protocol attaches an assessment of the achieved guarantee to returned query results, allowing precise reasoning about a query with a range of possible semantics.},

In this paper, we propose a “query domain” abstraction that allows an application to dynamically specify the nodes best suited to answering a particular query. To self-organize into such a coalition, nodes must satisfy a “proximity function”, a user-deﬁned function that constrains the relative relationship among the group of nodes (e.g., based on a property of the network or physical environment or a logical property of the nodes). The proximity function removes the need to explicitly tag nodes with context information, and it provides a convenient mechanism for forming coalitions on-the-ﬂy at query time. This facilitates the deployment of general-purpose sensor networks, where multiple applications can be run in the same network at the same time. In this paper, we model this abstraction, present a protocol to support the abstraction, and evaluate their performance.},

In this paper, we tackle one such challenge: the need of pervasive application developers to have access to constructs that enable resource discovery in dynamic environments. We ﬁrst deﬁne the evolving tuples model, a novel extension to traditional tuple spaces that allows applications to embed context-aware adaptation directly in structures traditionally used for distributed coordination. The behavior applications embed in evolving tuples can subsequently be used by discovery queries to allow environmental characteristics to directly impact the results of discovery. Our approach minimizes the amount of infrastructure that must be available to support discovery by embedding the discovery functionality almost exclusively within the tuple. At the same time, our model retains many of the beneﬁts of traditional tuple space approaches, namely providing content-based coordination that is easy for developers to understand and implement. The evolving tuple's inherent ﬂexibility also allows resource discovery to adapt to the changing resources in a pervasive environment.},

Existing research in CSCW (computer supported cooperative work), speciﬁcally approaches that attempt to make current application implementations collaboration-aware, are diﬃcult to implement for two reasons: the systems are focused too narrowly (e.g., on Internet-only applications), or the systems are simply too complicated to be adopted (e.g., they are hard to set up and adapt to concrete applications). Enabling real-time collaboration demands lightweight, modular middleware—sliverware—that enables the ﬁne-grained interactions required by collaborative applications. In this paper, we introduce sliverware and give a speciﬁc example in the guise of a distributed keyboard that multiplexes input from several users into a single stream that each user receives just like input from a normal keyboard. The result is simple, real-time collaboration based on a shared, distributed view of data that enables rapid development of highly coupled coordinating applications.},

The sheer amount of context information available for adaptation places a heightened burden on application developers as they must manage and utilize vast amounts of data from diverse sources. Facilitating programming in this data-rich environment requires a middleware that provides context information to applications in an abstract form. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a middleware that allows programmers to focus on high-level interactions among programs and to employ declarative abstract context speciﬁcations in settings that exhibit transient interactions with opportunistically encountered components. We also discuss the novel context-aware abstractions the middleware provides and the programming knowledge necessary to write applications using it.

Our framework then connects applications to dynamic resources through the use of a novel suite of application sessions. In this paper, we revisit this framework to devise a mechanism for applications to specify preferences for one service provider over another. In this investigation, we argue that these preferences are actually provided by a set of session participants: the application itself, the service provider, and, more surprisingly, the network that connects the application and the provider. We develop a framework for each of these parties to specify preferences among various allowable connections. We demonstrate not only what kinds of properties can be expressed in our framework but also implementation paths for integrating them into the communication and application support infrastructure.},

Furthermore, no middleware exists that facilitates provision of the required security qualities of mobile agent software while extensively focusing on easing the software development burden.

The very nature of the environment requires devices to interact opportunistically when resources are available. Such interactions occur unpredictably as device users have no advance knowledge of others they will encounter. The openness of these environments also requires users to protect themselves and their data from unwanted interactions while maintaining desired, yet unscripted, coordination. As the ubiquity of communicating mobile devices increases, the number of applications supported by the network grows drastically and managing access control is crucial to such systems. Application agents must directly manipulate and examine access policies because these networks are often decoupled from a ﬁxed infrastructure, rendering reliance on centralized servers for authentication and access policies impractical. In this paper, we explore context-aware access control policies tailored to the needs of agent coordination in open environments that exhibit mobility. We propose and evaluate novel constructs to support such policies, especially in the presence of large numbers of highly dynamic application agents.},

Successful end-user applications will not only learn to handle dynamic conditions, but will take advantage of the wide variety of available information and resources.

Such protocols for enabling an application agents task of gathering contextual information must function in a timely and adaptive fashion.

  abstractnote = {The increased pervasiveness of wireless mobile computing devices draws new attention to the need for coordination among small networked components. The very nature of the environment requires devices to interact opportunistically when resources are available. Such interactions occur unpredictably as mobile agents generally have no advance knowledge of other agents they will encounter over the lifetime of the application. In addition, as the ubiquity of communicating mobile devices increases, the number of application agents supported by the network grows drastically. Managing access control is crucial to such systems, and application agents must directly manipulate and examine access policies because the agents require full control over their data. However, because these networks are often decoupled from a ﬁxed infrastructure, reliance on centralized servers for authentication and access policies is impractical. In this paper, we explore the essential features of general access control policies tailored to the needs of agent coordination in the presence of physical and logical mobility. This access mechanism derives much of its ﬂexibility and expressiveness from its ability to take into account context information. We propose and evaluate novel constructs to support such policies, especially in the presence of large numbers of highly dynamic application agents.},

  abstractnote = {Context-awareness is emerging as an important computing paradigm designed to address the special needs of applications that must accommodate or exploit the highly dynamic environments that occur in the presence of physical or logical mobility. A number of formal models are available for reasoning about concurrency. Models designed to capture the speciﬁcs of mobility are fewer but still well represented (e.g., Mobile Ambients, π-Calculus, and Mobile UNITY). These models do not, however, provide constructs necessary for explicit modeling of context-aware interactions. This paper builds upon earlier eﬀorts on state-based formal reasoning about mobility and explores the process by which a model such as Mobile UNITY can be transformed to explicitly capture context-awareness. Starting with an examination of the essential features of context-aware systems, this paper explores a range of constructs designed to facilitate a highly decoupled style of programming among context-aware components. The result of this exploration is a model called Context UNITY.},

  abstractnote = {The increasing ubiquity of mobile devices has led to an explosion in the development of applications tailored to the particular needs of individual users. As the research community gains experience in the development of these applications, the need for middleware to simplify such software development is rapidly expanding. Vastly diﬀerent needs of these various applications, however, have led to the emergence of many diﬀerent middleware models, each of which approaches the dissemination of contextual information in a distinct way. The EgoSpaces model consists of logically mobile agents that operate over physically mobile hosts. EgoSpaces addresses the speciﬁc needs of individual agents, allowing them to deﬁne what data is to be included in their operating context by means of declarative speciﬁcations constraining properties of the data items, the agents that own the data, the hosts on which those agents are running, and attributes of the ad hoc network. In the resulting coordination model, agents interact with a dynamically changing environment through a set of views, custom deﬁned projections of the set of data objects present in the surrounding ad hoc network. This paper builds on EgoSpaces by allowing agents to assign automatic behaviors to the agent-deﬁned views. Behaviors consist of actions which are automatically performed in response to speciﬁed changes in the view. Behaviors discussed in this paper encompass reactive programming, transparent data migration, automatic data duplication, and event capture. Formal semantic deﬁnitions and programming examples are given for each behavior.},

  abstractnote = {Context-aware computing, an emerging paradigm in which applications sense and adapt their behavior to changes in their operational environment, is key to developing dependable software for use in the often unpredictable settings of ad hoc networks. However, designing an application which gathers, maintains, and adapts to context can be a diﬃcult undertaking, even for a seasoned programmer. Our goal is to simplify the programming task by hiding such issues from the programmer, allowing one to quickly and reliably produce a context-aware application for use in ad hoc networks. With this goal in mind, we introduce a novel abstraction called context-sensitive data structures (CSDS). The programmer interacts with the CSDS through a familiar programming interface, without direct knowledge of the context gathering and maintenance tasks that occur behind the scenes. In this paper, we deﬁne a model of context-sensitive data structures and present protocols which enable the programmer to construct and maintain a CSDS as a distributed structure over a mobile ad hoc network in a state of ﬂux.},

  abstractnote = {The design of ad hoc mobile applications often requires the availability of a consistent view of the application state among the participating hosts. Such views are important because they simplify both the programming and veriﬁcation tasks. We argue that preventing the occurrence of unannounced disconnection is essential to constructing and maintaining a consistent view in the ad hoc mobile environment. In this light, we provide the speciﬁcation for a partitionable group membership service supporting ad hoc mobile applications and propose a protocol for implementing the service. A unique property of this partitionable group membership is that messages sent between group members are guaranteed to be delivered successfully, given appropriate system assumptions. This property is preserved over time despite movement and frequent disconnections. The protocol splits and merges groups and maintains a logical connectivity graph based on a notion of safe-distance. An implementation of the protocol in Java is available for testing. The implementation is used to implement Lime 1, a middleware for mobility that supports transparent sharing of data in both wired and ad hoc wireless environments.},

  abstractnote = {Context-aware computing refers to a computing paradigm in which the behavior of individual components is determined by the circumstances in which they ﬁnd themselves to an extent that greatly exceeds the typical system/environment interaction pattern common to most modern computing. The environment has an exceedingly powerful impact on a particular application component either because the latter needs to adapt in response to changing external conditions or because it relies on resources whose availability is subject to continuous change. In this paper we seek to develop a systematic understanding of the quintessential nature of context-aware computing by constructing a formal model and notation for expressing context-aware computations. We start with the basic premise that, in its most extreme form, context should be made manifest in a manner that is highly local in appearance and decoupled in fact. Furthermore, we assume a notion of context that is relative to the needs of each individual component, and we expect context-awareness to be maintained in a totally transparent manner with minimal programming eﬀort. We construct the model from ﬁrst principles, seek to root our decisions in these formative assumptions, and make every eﬀort to preserve minimality of concepts and elegance of notation.},

We propose a new notion of context, which includes in principle any information reachable via the ad hoc network infrastructure but is restricted in practice to speciﬁc views of the overall context. The contents of each view will be deﬁned in terms of data, objects, or events exhibiting certain properties, associated with particular application components, residing on particular hosts, and part of some restricted subnet. Location, distance, movement proﬁle, access rights, and a lot more will be available for use in view speciﬁcations. The underlying system infrastructure will interpret the view speciﬁcations and continuously update the contents of user-deﬁned views despite dynamic changes in the speciﬁcations, state transitions at the application level, mobility of hosts in the physical space, and the migration of code among hosts.},

A coordination veneer is deﬁned as an adaptation layer that customizes a general-purpose coordination middleware to a particular domain with minimal development effort. This technique allows developers to build highly-tailored coordination models while leveraging established models and middleware. We present three such veneers, the coordination models they embody, and the manner in which they were implemented. The LIME middleware, which supplies tuple space based coordination in the ad hoc environment, serves as the implementation base for our veneers. These veneers cover diverse areas in ad hoc mobility: service discovery and provision, event registration and distribution, and secure tuple space access.},
