However, more natural human communication is much less constrained, allowing us to describe goals (e.g., "make it cozy in here") rather than specific actions. Current smart homes cannot understand such commands since they require creative reasoning about devices and settings as they relate to human situations. We approach this problem using large language models (LLMs), exploring their potential to control devices and create automation routines in response to under-specified user commands. We analyze the quality and failure modes of LLM-created action plans in the base case and introduce a key metric‚Äìtarget relevance‚Äìfor evaluating a model's performance at the task. Finally, we introduce Sasha, a smarter smart home assistant. Sasha responds to commands like "make it cozy" or "help me sleep better" by executing plans to achieve user goals‚Äîe.g., setting a mood with available devices, or devising automation routines. We demonstrate Sasha in a real-world implementation and user study, showing its capabilities and limitations when faced with unconstrained user-generated scenarios.</p> <p class="card-text"><b>Participants: </b>Evan King (Ph.D. student), Haoxiang (Steven) Yu (Ph.D. student), Sangsu Lee (Ph.D. student), Dr. Christine Julien (MPC director)</p> </div> </div></div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card-item col"> <a href="/research/continuous-neighbor-discovery/"><div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"><div class="col-md-12"> <div class="card-img float-right col-md-6"> <img src="/assets/img/projects/screen_shot_2017-10-20_at_8.43.29_am.png" alt="research thumbnail"> </div> <div class="card-body"> <h3 class="card-title">Continuous Neighbor Discovery</h3> <p class="card-text">Identifying ‚Äúwho is around‚Äù is key in a plethora of smart scenarios. Our work in this area investigates how to use off-the-shelf devices and technologies (e.g., WiFi direct and Bluetooth Low Energy) to enable lightweight and energy efficient device-to-device continuous discovery. While many solutions exist, they often take a theoretical approach, reasoning about protocol behavior with an abstract model that makes simplifying assumptions about the environment. This approach creates a gap between protocol implementations and the models used during design and analysis. Our work, in contrast is focused on solutions that can be realistically implemented and deployed on real devices and in support of real applications in a way that honestly considers real-world constraints. For instance, our approaches consider the very real effects of packet collisions, which have a real and measurable impact on applications relying on device-to-device neighbor discovery. To our knowledge, this is a first in this domain. Our ultimate goal is to directly empower developers with the ability to determine the optimal protocol configuration for their applications.</p> <p class="card-text"><b>Participants: </b>Jie Hua (Ph.D. student), Dr. Christine Julien (MPC director), Amy L.

Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous devices, often employing diverse communication technologies with varying energy consumption, discovery ranges, and transmission rates. These complexities pose a daunting setting for the development of IoT applications that could leverage direct communication with proximal mobile and embedded devices. While current approaches focus either on device discovery in the IoT setting or content transfer assuming established communication channels, none facilitate the intelligent discovery of useful devices and the seamless formation of temporary D2D connections to transfer content directly between devices. Our Omni middleware provides both of these features critical in the development of applications that leverage proximal devices in IoT settings. Using Omni, we demonstrate the feasibility of building applications that use heterogeneous D2D communication channels in an efficient and realistic (in terms of energy and time) manner.</p> <p class="card-text"><b>Participants: </b>Eftychia Vakaliou (Ph.D. student), Dr. Christine Julien (MPC director)</p> </div> </div></div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card-item col"> <a href="/research/opportunistic-federated-learning/"><div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"><div class="col-md-12"> <div class="card-img float-right col-md-6"> <img src="/assets/img/projects/ofl_arch.jpg" alt="research thumbnail"> </div> <div class="card-body"> <h3 class="card-title">Opportunistic Federated Learning</h3> <p class="card-text">Opportunistic Federated Learning (OFL) is an encounter-based learning paradigm in pervasive environments.

The basis of Project SMART is a cooperative educational game that has been adapted to use CS/CT to provide not only learning opportunities but also a focus on the health and educational benefits of physical activity, leveraging organized physical activity opportunities during the school day. <br> <br> The project relies on community based participatory research to create a researcher-practitioner partnership that includes university researchers in health education and computer science, elementary school administrators and teachers, and K-12 computer science education experts. The combination of physical activity and CS/CT learning in the elementary school classroom is an important novel contribution of this work. There currently exists little emphasis on improving computational thinking in elementary curricula. Computer science pathways that do exist often fail to engage student populations that are traditionally underserved. <br> <br> Project moveSMART uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) learning activities. Within the platform, a class cooperatively earns credit for performing physical activity like participating in physical education class or playing outside at recess. This credit takes the form of distances traveled on a virtual path (e.g., along Route 66 across the United States). As the class makes progress, they unlock waypoints that contain CS/CT learning modules as well as additional learning activities directly tied to the required school curriculum. Within the platform, we have developed a series of tutorials designed to introduce elementary students to CS/CT by making connections to physical activity and grade-level curricula in other subjects. Through these tutorials, students create a physical activity monitor using the BBC micro:bit. <br> <br> Through our work in Project SMART, which also includes professional development sessions for elementary school teachers, we have surfaced multiple challenges that include pressures for all instruction to adhere to required standards, a lack of contextualization of CS/CT content, and unreliable at-home Internet that makes it difficult to reinforce lessons outside of school. By tying CS/CT to students‚Äô own physical activity, we address the dual problems of declining physical activity in children and a lack of contextualization of CS/CT content. To further address identified barriers, we co-designed game elements with classroom teachers to enable cross-curricular connections, including connecting CS/CT to language arts, cultural studies, music, etc.</p> <p class="card-text"><b>Participants: </b>Dr. Christine Julien (MPC director), Dr. Darla Castelli (collaborator at The University of Texas at Austin), Dr. Jamie Payton (collaborator at Temple University)</p> </div> </div></div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card-item col"> <a href="/research/warble/"><div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"><div class="col-md-12"> <div class="card-img float-right col-md-6"> <img src="/assets/img/projects/warble.png" alt="research thumbnail"> </div> <div class="card-body"> <h3 class="card-title">Warble: Middleware for Discovery in the IoT</h3> <p class="card-text">Advances in sensing and networking along with ubiquitous Internet connectivity have paved the way for today's massive Internet of Thing (IoT) market.

Enabling personalized IoT experiences requires an open infrastructure, backed by expressive and flexible middleware that enables developing applications to address diverse individual needs.

Many commercial and academic approaches have been developed for autonomous thermostat control to reduce unnecessary HVAC usage. Such systems typically reduce HVAC usage by adjusting the thermostat setting while the house is unoccupied, so as not to disrupt occupants' thermal comfort. We instead consider the balance of the financial burden of HVAC costs with occupants' comfort desires. Balance is an agent-based approach to autonomous thermostat control that is based on the idea that many people are comfortable in a range of temperatures (for example, 68 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer). Those wishing to meet a certain energy bill each month may wish to adjust the thermostat in order to save money, but mentally converting from the thermostat setting to dollars on an energy bill is challenging, due to the variable impact of weather and household activities on energy used. <br> <br> Our Balance agent therefore aims to meet the user's monetary HVAC budget by adjusting the thermostat setting within the range of temperatures the user finds comfortable. The agent has two constraints - to meet the user's budget and to stay within the user's comfort range; and one optimization - maximize the user's comfort within that range. To-date, we have implemented a simple agent that accomplishes this task in realistic simulated environments, using real-time HVAC consumption data and indoor and outdoor temperature data to determine thermostat settings at regular intervals throughout each day. Ongoing work on Balance includes: 1) improving the Balance agent's control strategy through reinforcement learning techniques; 2) deploying the Balance agent in the real world, using an Ecobee Smart Thermostat; and 3) investigating the use of feedback, for example if a user provides a budget that is simply not feasible with the user's comfort levels.</p> <p class="card-text"><b>Participants: </b>Kate McArdle (Ph.D. student), Dr. Christine Julien (MPC director)</p> </div> </div></div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card-item col"> <a href="/research/brace/"><div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"><div class="col-md-12"> <div class="card-body"> <h3 class="card-title">Brace</h3> <p class="card-text">Brace is a framework that allows developers to explicitly specify both physical and logical assumptions and expected behaviors.

We have developed a novel publish-subscribe based technique to drive device-to-device data exchange in situations when peers have overlapping interests. Our approach breaks large (media heavy) data into small chunks, and interested mobile peers issue subscriptions and publications over these chunks. An interested device can then receive chunks from the infrastructure or via opportunistic connections to mobile peers. We provide a very lightweight beacon mechanism to exchange interests, and each peer serves chunks of data based on its assessment of the information diversity in the neighborhood of peers. We have implemented our approach in an Android application. The protocol is called Disseminate. Our Android implementation runs on stock Android (assuming support for WiFi-Direct). Using this implementation and through simulation, we have demonstrated that Disseminate improves over state of the art alternatives in terms of overall network overhead and delivery latency.</p> <p class="card-text"><b>Participants: </b>Tomasz Kalbarczyk (Ph.D. student), Venkat Srinivasan (Undergraduate student), Dr. Christine Julien (MPC director)</p> </div> </div></div> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card-item col"> <a href="/research/gander/"><div class="card hoverable"> <div class="row g-0"><div class="col-md-12"> <div class="card-img float-right col-md-6"> <img src="/assets/img/projects/secondaryquery.png" alt="research thumbnail"> </div> <div class="card-body"> <h3 class="card-title">Gander</h3> <p class="card-text">Gander is a distributed search engine for mobile networked environments characterized by high volumes of short-lived data.

We use novel data structures such as probabilistic Bloomier filters to represent context information efficiently and minimize the network resources required to support Grapevine's use. <br> <br> Our long term vision is a framework that allows a pervasive computing application developer to delegate all context related functionality to Grapevine and focus solely on the task at hand. Instead of spending time determining what context information is needed, who it should be sent to, and managing the lifecycle of the information it has received, a Grapevine-enabled application can merely indicate the context information it has to offer and the context information it is interested in receiving. Achieving this vision leaves many interesting research challenges such as communicating and responding to interest gradients within the network, determining the frequency with which information should be sent, assessing a quality metric for the context information on hand, and finding ways to provide all this functionality without placing undue burden on the limited resources available to pervasive computing platforms. <br> <br> This project is funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation under grants CNS-0844850 and CNS-1218232.
