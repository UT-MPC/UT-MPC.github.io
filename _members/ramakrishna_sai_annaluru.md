description: I'm currently a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. My research is primarily centered on integrating data science with physical activity to transform computer science education in order to serve historically excluded elementary learners. During my masters, my research focused on applications of deep learning to radar signal processing and sensor fusion. Outside of research, I enjoy watching/playing basketball, practicing my Tabla (an Indian hand-drum instrument), and eating different kinds of vegetarian food.
