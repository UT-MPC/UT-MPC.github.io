    Kate's research interests lie in the intersections of smart grid, pervasive computing, and machine learning. She is currently focused on developing an autonomous thermostat control agent that balances a user's desired comfort range with a monthly budget for heating and cooling costs. Her research is funded by an NSF IGERT traineeship in Sustainable Grids, at the heart of which is a partnership with Pecan Street Inc.
