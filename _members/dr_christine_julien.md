title: Dr. Christine Julien
email: c.julien@utexas.edu
description: Dr. Julien is a professor in the Center for Advanced Research in Software Engineering (ARiSE) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, which she joined in 2004. She is the director of the Mobile and Pervasive Computing Group, where her research focuses on the intersection of software engineering and dynamic, unpredictable networked environments. Her specific focus is on the development of models, abstractions, tools, and middleware whose goals are to ease the software engineering burden associated with building applications for pervasive and mobile computing environments. Dr. Julien's research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Department of Defense, and Freescale Semiconductors. The work has been recognized by an NSF CAREER award and an AFOSR Young Investigator Award, and the results have appeared in many peer reviewed journal and conference papers. Dr. Julien graduated with her D.Sc. in 2004 from Washington University in Saint Louis, where her doctoral research under the supervision of Dr. Gruia-Catalin Roman focused on developing a middleware called EgoSpaces that provided an intuitive data-structure abstraction to support application coordination in mobile computing environments. She earned her M.S. degree in 2003 and her B.S. with majors in Computer Science and Biology in 2000 (both also from Wash. U.).
